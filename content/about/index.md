My name’s Lina Wilske and I am a computer science student @ HPI, focusing on security. I am deepening my knowledge as a teaching assistant and tutor in the module “iOS & Android Internals” and conducting research in the field of Mobile Security at the research group of Jiska Classen. In my leisure time, I participate in CTFs with the Platypwnies, the CTF team of our Cybersecurity club.
