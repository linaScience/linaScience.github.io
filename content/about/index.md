My name’s Lina Wilske and I am studying computer science student @ HPI focussing on security. I am deepening my knowledge as teaching assistant and tutor in the module “iOS & Android Internals” and research in the field of Mobile Security at the research group of Jiska Classen.
In my leisure I participate in CTFs with the Platypwnies, the CTF team of our Cybersecurity club.
