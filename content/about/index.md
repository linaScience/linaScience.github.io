My name’s Lina Wilske and I am a computer science student @ HPI focussing on security. Currently, I am co-leading the Cybersecurity club at our university and working as teaching assistant and tutor in the module “Cybersecurity in Practice” (CiP). I am also a proud member of the Platypwnies, the CTF team of our club.
