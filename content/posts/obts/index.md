Since I am one of the nine scholars at OBTS v6.0 I will be writing my experience on this blog.

The OBTS is a five-day long event, consisting of three days of training followed by two days of conference.
I am taking part in the "Practical iOS App, User-, and Kernel-Space Reverse-Engineering" training by Jiska Classen and Fabian Freyer.
